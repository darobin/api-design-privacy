        This document provides some background on the threats to users' privacy that Javascript APIs help create
        on the Web, and provides some strategies to mitigate such threats at the API design level. Its primary
        audience is therefore people involved in the definition and implementation of such APIs.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        User privacy is a core feature of the Web. As the Web continues its evolution into a powerful application
        platform, an increasing number of its additional abilities risk compromising user privacy unless they
        are specifically created to promote it. While potentially present in all aspects of the Web platform,
        this issue is particularly salient when it comes to Javascript APIs since they comprise one of the
        most frequent and natural extensibility point for powerful features that can be misused, and that are
        hard to mitigate against.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads to a strong requirement on these APIs to take user privacy into account. This, in turn, imposes
        design constraints that are different from those found in more traditional applications programming which
        entails that experience with APIs designed for the latter seldom applies in full and needs to be revisited.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this document we consider only those aspects of privacy and APIs that can be mitigated by API designers,
        notably providing more information than is necessary for a given operation, not making it possible for the
        user to control what information is being shared, and user fingerprinting. Conversely we do not cover other
        privacy attacks such as tricking the user into providing information or maliciously using collected information
        in ways that were not agreed to by the user. We have chosen this focus because well-designed APIs from the 
        privacy standpoint should provide a solid foundation for better user privacy in general, because they can help
        address the problem at the root, and because we feel that they form a coherent whole.
      </p>

        <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>
          It is common for discussions of these privacy issues to raise objections that they are a matter of security
          and not privacy. Conversely, if raised as matters of security, objections will surface according to which
          they constitute a specifically privacy problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the authors' considered opinion that this distinction is both immaterial and irrelevant. Both privacy
          and security are fundamental promises of the Web user agent; when they are broken users suffer and the Web
          dysfunctions. Providing the means to address the issues raised in this document is therefore a positive
          step forward irrespective of the way in which they are categorised.
