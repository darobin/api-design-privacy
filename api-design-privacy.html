        This document provides some background on the threats to users' privacy that Javascript APIs help create
        on the Web, and provides some strategies to mitigate such threats at the API design level. Its primary
        audience is therefore people involved in the definition and implementation of such APIs.

      - what is privacy by design (find nice definition of security by design)
      - the difference between security and privacy â€” it depends on how you want to look at it, and it doesn't matter
      - save what can be from:
        - Dan's document
        - Frederick's document
      - what is fingerprinting
        - pilfer from Panopticlick
      - Mitigation strategies
        - minimisation
        - user mediation
        - action-based availability (gamepad, mouse)
